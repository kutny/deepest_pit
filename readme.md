# Deepest pit calculation

## Usage

```
docker-run.sh
cd /app
```

### Compare both algorithms on the original task data

array: [7, 15, 12, 1, 11, 15, 85, 13, 13, 43, 30, 45, 30, 44]

```
php pit.php
```

### Run the speedtest

```
php speedtest.php
```

The speed test compares the original algorithm to the new one in terms of processing speed.

### Compare both algorithms on random arrays of integers

```
php compare_test.php
```
